# imageChecker

A simple program (script?) for checking if images in one folder are referenced in XML files in another folder.

1. Download imageChecker.py
2. Download the TestContent folder so you have some sample files to play with.
3. Open the script and update  imagePath = " " to point to the images folder in the TestContent directory. Examples: C:/Desktop/TestContent/images or /home/docs/userguide/images/
4. Update and "filePath = " " value to point to the xml folder in the TestContent directory. Examples: C:/Desktop/TestContent/xml or /home/docs/userguide/
5. If you're running the script on Linux, change the permissions on the file so you can execute it: chmod +x imageChecker.py
